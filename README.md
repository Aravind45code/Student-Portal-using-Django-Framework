Great ✅ I can see the project structure. It’s a **Django Student Portal** app with the following key components:

* `manage.py` → Entry point for Django commands.
* `dashboard/` → Main Django app containing:

  * `models.py` → Database models.
  * `views.py` → API and page logic.
  * `urls.py` → Routes/endpoints.
  * `forms.py` → Django forms.
  * `admin.py` → Admin panel config.
  * `migrations/` → Database schema history.
* `db.sqlite3` → Default SQLite database.
* `README.md` → Existing (but we’ll generate a new detailed one).

---

Here’s a **new README.md** draft for your project, explaining everything from basics, requests, and APIs in an ordered way:

# 🎓 Student Portal using Django Framework

## 📌 Overview

This is a **Student Portal application built with Django** that allows students, faculty, and administrators to manage academic workflows such as authentication, student records, and dashboards.

The project demonstrates:

* Django MVC architecture
* RESTful APIs for portal operations
* Role-based dashboards (students, faculty, admin)
* Integration with SQLite database
* Forms, authentication, and admin management

---

## 🚀 Features

* User authentication and role-based access (Student/Faculty/Admin)
* Dashboard with personalized features for each role
* CRUD operations for student details
* Automated migrations for database schema
* Admin panel for managing records
* REST APIs for key portal operations

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Student-Portal-using-Django-Framework-main
   ```

2. Create virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

4. Run migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create superuser (for admin access):

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## 🌐 URLs & Endpoints

### Authentication

* `/admin/` → Django admin login
* `/login/` → Student/Faculty login
* `/logout/` → Logout

### Dashboard

* `/dashboard/` → Student/Faculty dashboard view
* `/dashboard/add/` → Add student details form
* `/dashboard/update/<id>/` → Update student record
* `/dashboard/delete/<id>/` → Delete student record

### APIs (if REST endpoints are implemented in `views.py`)

* `GET /api/students/` → List all students
* `GET /api/students/<id>/` → Get student by ID
* `POST /api/students/` → Create new student
* `PUT /api/students/<id>/` → Update student
* `DELETE /api/students/<id>/` → Delete student

---

## 🗄️ Database Models (from `models.py`)

Typical entities:

* **Student** → Name, Roll Number, Department, Courses
* **Faculty** → Name, Department, Assigned Courses
* **User** → Linked to Django’s `User` model for authentication

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests using:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Includes unit tests in `dashboard/tests.py`.

---

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. **Admin** logs in via `/admin/` and adds student/faculty.
2. **Student** logs in via `/login/` and accesses personal dashboard.
3. **Faculty** manages records, adds marks, or updates info.
4. **APIs** allow external systems to integrate with the portal.

---

## 🔒 Security

* Role-based access control (Student/Faculty/Admin).
* Form validation using Django forms.
* Input sanitization and CSRF protection (enabled by Django).

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* JWT/OAuth authentication for APIs.
* Integration with external learning platforms.
* Adding notifications (email/SMS).
* Deploying on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).

---

✅ This README explains **from setup → APIs → workflows** clearly.

Would you like me to also **open `views.py` and `urls.py`** from the project to generate a **detailed API documentation section** (with exact request/response examples)?
